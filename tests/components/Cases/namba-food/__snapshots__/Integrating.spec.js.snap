    Integrating new business with 1000+ products takes less than a few hours. The scalability of Namba Food enables
    its managers to integrate new business partners into a system quickly. Managers prepare an Excel file with
    structured menu or product data.

    Managing partners' content is straightforward, as managers can quickly turn on or off a position inside the
    catalogue and change pictures and descriptions. Such flexibility enables business owners to meet daily business
    needs. For example, if a cafe offers a seasonal menu, the items from the summer menu can be temporarily turned off
    during the rest of the year.

        The control panel enables operators to manage promo codes and items ordered from a shop or restaurant. The
        panel makes it easy to get an order status overview, make required corrections and cancel orders if necessary.

        communicated during the process.
