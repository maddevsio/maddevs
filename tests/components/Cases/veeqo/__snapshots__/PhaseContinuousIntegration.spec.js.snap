        Development processes lacked consistency. Particularly, the project had manually configured CI system and pipelines, different development, test, and production environments and runtimes, non-reproducible development environment, inconsistent test builds.

        Dockerization is the most viable solution today to set up continuous delivery. As our application was back then partially hosted on Heroku, we created a unified runtime for developers and CI by dockerizing the main app using a Heroku Stack image and Docker Compose. It made CI reliable and allowed simplifying deployment. Also, it sped up bootstrapping of the development environment.

    The developers didn’t trust their CI system. CI wasn’t helping them; it was hindering their work instead. It’s just bad DevOps.

    Moving Jenkins

    Jenkins was operated manually on a separate EC2 instance. Managing it was thus challenging, especially in emergencies. We moved the Jenkins master to ECS by remaking its provisioning, deployment, and updating (Later, we’ll move it to k8s, but in 2017, ECS was the only good option for us). We reduced build time and cost by allocating a small part of compute resources of Jenkins agents to reserved instances and moving 90% of the load to spot instances.

      <li

        Creating backups

    Everything down to the last comma is now written in the form of code. Even if we took Jenkins down completely and had to build it from scratch again, it’d take us no more than 10 minutes.
