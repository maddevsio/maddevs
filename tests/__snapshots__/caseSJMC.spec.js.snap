    There is much to learn from the Great War, however, ordinary history books often only explain events on a
    surface level. In contrast, using interactive multimedia installations and technologies, the 480-square metre
    interpretive centre takes visitors on a journey in the footsteps of ordinary soldiers who experienced
    extraordinary events.

      Devs partnership has therefore been based on enhancements and preventative maintenance contracts.

      The MMIT Brain synchronises two information systems: the multimedia management system and the smart building
      management system. The multimedia software and hardware management system controls, supervises and monitors
      lighting, audio, video and special effects for the SJMC. The universal software infrastructure to building
      controls infrastructure integrators is the third-party framework that works as a foundation of the SJMC
      intelligent building. It supports a complete IP-based information network for real-time management and
      controls the SJMC's multiple facilities. This one-stop software manages all building operations, energy,
      security, and operational systems.

      The gallery's small size and the volume and density of signal traffic from visitors is a challenge that was
      solved using a complex, layered positioning algorithm that was developed to help deal with the unique
      challenges of SJMC’s physical environment.

      When visitors move around the centre, the app will continually refresh a list of the content that is available
      nearby and allow them to create their own experience.

      WATCHOUT is a multi-display production and presentation system that enables the SJMC to arrange displays in
      unusual ways and create seamless images and videos. The absence of gaps between display surfaces is possible
      due to the WATCHOUT system that distributes the content and keeps everything in sync across all connected
      displays.

      Essentially, BRIX is an ultra-compact multimedia computer that can be hung on a wall. The advanced graphics
      card delivers heavy content to multiple monitors simultaneously. Moreover, each BRIX is managed by the MMIT
      Brain to work in synchronisation with mobile applications.

      As thousands of kilometres separate the SJMC and Mad Devs’ office, a unique approach to the engineering
      partnership was required.

      After purchasing the required equipment and reading code and documentation, in one month after understanding
      the complexity of the SJMC, Mad Devs’ DevOps and back-end engineers built a custom small-scale version of the
      SJMC complex multimedia environment. Thus, testing and deploying new content and changes in the Brain was made
      possible even kilometres away from the real SJMC.

      Although the previous vendors have developed incredible software, an independent organisation prepared a
      detailed audit and evaluated deficiencies or areas of improvement.

      The complexity of the system raises particular challenges for the Mad Devs team, as they had to submerge
      themselves into the full comprehensiveness of the Brain solution to be able to improve it. It took our team a
      month of onboarding and reading documentation before we could fix even a minor issue.

      On top of that, by establishing an efficient testing process we significantly increased iOS and Android
      applications' 40% test coverage that ultimately prevented defect leakage. Moreover, after fighting 1000+ minor
      defects and optimising applications to support the latest mobile operating systems, Mad Devs’ engineers
      successfully finished the technical debt on time and planned the deployment of the changes on site.

      To achieve maximum observability of the SJMC hardware Grafana was used to build all the graphs for the current
      state. It enables the Mad Devs team to configure the reports and alerts if any of the system components fail
      or are under high load or in case of any other problem.

      Logstash ingests, transforms, and ships SJMC logging data from 100+ BRIX (multimedia computers). Before
      unstructured logging data was scattered across hundreds of folders and was not properly monitored, which
      ultimately caused breakages and deterioration of expensive hardware. Now Logstash collects and transforms
      logging data by sending it to Elasticsearch. Elasticsearch enables the SJMC to store, search, and analyse
      logged data with ease at scale.

    Testing the accuracy of new content and feature deployment is a challenge due to the 5000 km distance that
    separate Mad Devs’ office and the SJMC. Thus, our back-end developers developed two types of emulation
    software that enables Mad Devs to test the MMIT Brain without accumulating additional travel expenses.

    The emulator code tests the interaction of two independent information systems that control multimedia
    software and intelligent infrastructure integrations.

    The internal information systems synchronisation emulator makes the infrastructure control system believe that
    emulated hardware is real.

    For example, in case of an emergency like a water leakage, a smart building control system that controls
    electricity has to communicate the emergency to multimedia software through the MMIT Brain and turn off all
    multimedia computers to avoid closure.
  
        </p>

    Without such an emulator, Mad Devs’ developers would not be able to look at the MMIT Brain code and understand
    whether the Brain has transferred the command from one system to another. Without such an emulator, the team
    would be clueless regarding whether the command had been successfully executed or not.

    All possible interactions with WATCHOUT site multimedia computers including touch screens, multiple users

    According to the internal CSAT survey, 98% of Mad Devs' customers find the company's service great value for
    money, and most of them stay with us for 3+ years. The SJMC is no exception.

    We are honoured to extend our partnership to improve the SJMC visitors' experience by introducing the iPadOS
    application for children. This application will offer engaging content which allows children to discover the
    centre and its resources through a series of educational games. Moreover, Mad Devs is going to develop a
    sophisticated content management system that is eventually going to simplify the deployment of new content and
    will enable the managers of the SJMC themselves to make the required changes with ease.
