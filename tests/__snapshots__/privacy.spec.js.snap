        You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However,
        we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively,
        we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

        We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to
        access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that
        personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask
        you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
