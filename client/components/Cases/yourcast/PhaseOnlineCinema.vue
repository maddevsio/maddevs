        Phase 1: Online cinema

      <TextParagraph class="m-24_bottom">
        Initially, it was decided to create a movie library with previews, duration information, etc. Purchasing videos
        was the easiest part. Pulling a good description for each movie from an external source eliminated the routine
        work related to content management. To address this issue.

        To support the rising demand for content, the platform needed to accommodate TV shows and series. Each
        TV series collection was split into seasons for better navigation. Viewers could track their progress; some
        series were marked as already watched, and the remaining were added to the suggested content. The
        viewer could mark episodes as watched, or the platform did it automatically for them.
