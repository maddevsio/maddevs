          How much does software development cost? How do you charge?
        </h2>
        <p class="faq__paragraph">
          Our pricing has always been transparent. We charge our customers on a
          <span class="faq__nowrap">‘Time & Material’</span> basis which makes the costs predictable as there are known
          rates for each specialist, from developer to PM. This ensures great control over budget and provides the
          required level of flexibility as the projects’ scope can be easily corrected on the go. Thus, in the end,
          together we deliver a product that truly solves <span class="faq__nowrap">end-customers’</span> needs.

          How can I control my project budget?
        </h2>
        <p class="faq__paragraph">
          You will have full control over your budget with our detailed monthly invoice. Weekly and daily reports cover
          the team’s contribution to your project in addition to individual performance reports that tell you what each
          of the specialists you hired has accomplished. Thus, with all information in your hands, the right adjustments
          in priorities of cost control factors can be implemented.

          How do you ensure security for confidential information? Do you work under NDA?

        <p class="faq__paragraph">
          <span class="faq__nowrap">Mad Devs</span> always works under the NDA of our own, however, if you have a

          How do you mitigate the risks related to intellectual property ownership?
        </h2>
        <p class="faq__paragraph">
          Intellectual Property is wholly owned by you and your company.
        </p>
        <p class="faq__paragraph faq__paragraph-margin">
          After you sign a contract with us, you will become the owner of the repository, the project environment,
          Slack, hosting, and etc. The team only manages this and adjusts the processes in accordance with the
          regulations of the company.
        </p>
        <p class="faq__paragraph faq__paragraph-margin">
          You have these accesses from the very beginning of the project, but it is important to remember that according
          to the contract you become a full owner only after paying for all the hours worked by the team.
