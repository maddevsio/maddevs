          Sir John Monash Centre (SJMC) tells the Australian and New Zealand army corps’ story of the Western Front in the words of those who served.

        <TextParagraph class="m-24_bottom media-m-12_bottom">
          WWI was an incredible teacher. However, its wisdom is thought by dull, dehumanized historical books that explain events on a surface level. In contrast, the 480-square meter Centre takes visitors to a journey telling the stories of ordinary soldiers who went through those horrible events using interactive multimedia installations and technologies.

          Technologies allow SJMC to personalize the experience for each visitor and tell ANZAC’s stories with "full immersion" that you've never seen anywhere else.

          SJMC officially opened its doors on April 16th, 2018. The entire centre with its underground building and cutting-edge technologies was already developed and deployed by an Australia-based IT vendor. Thus, the SJMC and Mad Devs partnership was based on enhancements and preventative maintenance contracts.
