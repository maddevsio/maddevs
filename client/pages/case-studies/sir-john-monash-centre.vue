          The Sir John Monash Centre (SJMC) tells Australia’s story of the Western Front during the First World War in the words of those who served.

        <TextParagraph class="m-24_bottom media-m-12_bottom">
          There is much to learn from the Great War, however, ordinary history books often only explain events on a surface level. In contrast, using interactive multimedia installations and technologies, the 480-square metre interpretive centre takes visitors on a journey in the footsteps of ordinary soldiers who experienced extraordinary events.

        <TextParagraph>
          The SJMC’s technology enables each visitor to personalise their experience as they learn about the Australian soldiers’ stories. Visitors are "fully immersed" in a way that is not seen anywhere else.

          The SJMC opened to the public on April 16th, 2018. The entire centre, including its half-sunken building and cutting-edge new technology, was developed and deployed by an Australian-based IT vendor. The SJMC and Mad Devs partnership has therefore been based on enhancements and preventative maintenance contracts.

          Integration of Sentry provides the Mad Devs team with automated error tracking and shows us every fault that happens with the SJMC MMIT Brain by organising its logs. Sentry enables the Mad Devs team to identify, prioritise, and reproduce each issue.

          Auto-testing of the MMIT Brain can be sorted into two categories:

        <List class="m-32_bottom">
          <ListItemDot>The synchronisation of two internal information systems.</ListItemDot>
          <ListItemDot>End to end testing to ensure seamless user experience for thousands of SJMC visitors.</ListItemDot>
        </List>
        <TextParagraph class="m-72_bottom media-m-48_bottom">
          Testing the accuracy of new content and feature deployment is a challenge due to the 5000 km distance that separate Mad Devs’ office and the SJMC. Thus, our back-end developers developed two types of emulation software that enables Mad Devs to test the MMIT Brain without accumulating additional travel expenses.
        </TextParagraph>
        <h3 class="case_title_h3 m-12_bottom">1. Internal information systems synchronization</h3>
        <TextParagraph>
          The emulator code tests the interaction of two independent information systems that control multimedia software and intelligent infrastructure integrations.
        </TextParagraph>
        <TextQuoteBox class="m-auto m-48_top m-48_bottom media-m-24_top media-m-24_bottom">
          The internal information systems synchronisation emulator makes the infrastructure control system believe that emulated hardware is real.
        </TextQuoteBox>
        <TextParagraph class="m-24_bottom media-m-12_bottom">
          For example, in case of an emergency like a water leakage, a smart building control system that controls electricity has to communicate the emergency to multimedia software through the MMIT Brain and turn off all multimedia computers to avoid closure.
        </TextParagraph>
        <TextParagraph class="m-72_bottom media-m-48_bottom">
          Without such an emulator, Mad Devs’ developers would not be able to look at the MMIT Brain code and understand whether the Brain has transferred the command from one system to another. Without such an emulator, the team would be clueless regarding whether the command had been successfully executed or not.
        </TextParagraph>
        <h3 class="case_title_h3">2. End to end tests using emulators of mobile applications</h3>
        <TextQuoteBox class="m-auto m-48_top m-48_bottom media-m-24_top media-m-24_bottom">
          A mobile applications emulator enables the SJMC to run all possible user experiences on all possible virtual multimedia sites.
        </TextQuoteBox>
        <TextParagraph class="m-96_bottom media-m-48_bottom">
          All possible interactions with WATCHOUT site multimedia computers including touch screens, multiple users watching simultaneously, and switching audio and subtitle languages usually last a minimum of 6 hours. The emulator for end to end testing accomplishes the tests in just 20 minutes.

          According to the internal CSAT survey, 98% of Mad Devs' customers find the company's service great value for money, and most of them stay with us for 3+ years. The SJMC is no exception.

          We are honoured to extend our partnership to improve the SJMC visitors' experience by introducing the iPadOS application for children. This application will offer engaging content which allows children to discover the centre and its resources through a series of educational games. Moreover, Mad Devs is going to develop a sophisticated content management system that is eventually going to simplify the deployment of new content and will enable the managers of the SJMC themselves to make the required changes with ease.
